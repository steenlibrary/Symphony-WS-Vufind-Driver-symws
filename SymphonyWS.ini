; This section is used to define library codes and named values which are used by the
; system to indicate the location at which a hold is to be collected. If you leave it
; commented out, a list will automatically be generated using the getPickUpLocations
; method.  Your system will perform better if you fill this in, since it will reduce
; the number of database lookups necessary when presenting the hold form.
