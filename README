Symphony WS Vufind Driver
------------------
This driver was designed for Vufind 1.2 and above, although it should work with 1.1.  

UPDATE (07/19/2012):
	The driver repo has been moved to:
	https://github.com/steenlibrary/Symphony-WS-Vufind-Driver-symws-SOAP

UPDATE (06/20/2012): 
	1. Supports new features in 1.4
	2. getMyFines fixed to show individual fines instead of only fine total.
	3. getMyFines fee type configurable from SymphonyWS.ini.
	4. Still experimenting with the reserves functionality.  The reserves service in symws is buggy and not well suited for ingestion into Vufind, but I will keep trying!
	5. Showing staff notes in holdings is configurable from SymphonyWS.ini.
	6. Showing account log in is configurable from SymphonyWS.ini.
	7. Showing base call number in search hit list is configurable in SymphonyWS.ini.
		

Feel free to fork!
